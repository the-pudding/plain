Governments use them to guide internal and external communications. Teachers, schools and textbook manufacturers use them to tailor reading assignments to particular grade levels and students.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To better understand how readability scores work—and how they can fail—let’s look at three representative examples.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The author Rudolf Flesch made a career as an early evangelist for plain language in the mid-20th century, promoting his namesake Flesch Reading-Ease Test and its cousin, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula, developed in 1975 under contract with the U.S. Navy. It was calibrated on the reading comprehension scores of 531 enlisted Navy personnel, in order to measure readability in the specific context of technical communication. Today, perhaps thanks to its misleading name, the F-K Grade Level Formula is used in schools to estimate reading difficulty for children, overlooking the obvious fact that elementary school students and naval cadets may not agree on whether the same text is easy or difficult to understand.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The F-K Grade level formula looks, in part, at syllable count, based on the idea that words with fewer syllables are easier to understand.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Rudolf Flesch created the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula when he was working for the Navy. He measured how well 531 people in the Navy could read technical communications. Technical communications have special information that people in the Navy need to do their jobs.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Now we use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula to measure readings for children. But the score has never been tested with children.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Flesch-Kincaid formula measures two things:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-1fij7qx"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How long words are.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How many words are in a sentence.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li>
      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The formula says the shorter the words and sentence, the easier it is to read.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

The original Dale-Chall list of “familiar words” was compiled in 1948 through a survey of U.S. fourth-graders, and even the most recent update to the list in 1995 retains obsolete words like “Negro” and "homely" while omitting “computer.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

      <div class="plain svelte-e1da8e"><div class="svelte-1fij7qx"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dale-Chall is another readability score.

          </figure><div class="standard svelte-e1da8e visible"><div class="svelte-1fij7qx"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->More recently, US schools and textbook manufacturers have standardized their curricula on the Lexile Framework for Reading, a set of readability algorithms and vocabulary lists designed to automatically match students with appropriately difficult books. Publishers apply Lexile to their texts to rate their difficulty. A Lexile score of 210 indicates an easy-to-read book, while a score of 1730 indicates a very challenging one. A reading comprehension test assigns a corresponding reading score to each student, after which teachers pair students with texts that have comparable Lexile scores.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The approach sounds simple enough, but critics have pointed out absurdities in Lexile's results. According to Lexile, The Grapes of Wrath (Lexile score: 680) is easier to understand than the Nancy Drew mystery Nancy's Mysterious Letter (score: 720), but neither of these is as challenging as The Library Mouse (score: 860), a 32-page illustrated children's book.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
</div></div>
      <div class="plain svelte-e1da8e"><div class="svelte-1fij7qx"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lexile Framework for Reading is another formula to measure how easy something is to read. Schools and textbook writers use Lexile. Lexile helps match students with books they are able to read.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Here is how it works:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-1fij7qx"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lexile scores books. It rates them as easy or hard to read.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Students take a reading test. It tells them how well they read.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Teachers give students books that won’t be too easy or too hard for them to read.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li>
      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But the scores Lexile gives books don’t always make sense. Here’s an example. Lexile says:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-1fij7qx"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lexile says that The Grapes of Wrath is a pretty easy book to read. The Grapes of Wrath is a book for adults. It is over 400 pages long and has many complex themes and ideas.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lexile says the Nancy Drew book Nancy’s Mysterious Letter is harder to read than The Grapes of Wrath. Nancy Drew books are made for preteens. Most people would consider it much easier to read than The Grapes of Wrath.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Lexile says The Library Mouse is harder to read than the Nancy Drew book or The Grapes of Wrath. The Library Mouse is a picture book for children.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li>
      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It does not make sense that a children’s picture book would be harder to read than a book for adults.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

          </figure><div class="standard svelte-e1da8e visible"><div class="svelte-1fij7qx"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How exactly are Lexile scores calculated? Unfortunately for us, the Lexile Framework is the intellectual property of MetaMetrics, the private company that created it, so we can only guess at the secret recipe, but it's a pretty good bet that Lexile scores depend on a mixture of the same factors used in Flesch–Kincaid and other open-source readability measures.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Formulas based on surface level text properties and word frequency have clear limitations. None of them consider how well organized the information is, or whether the sentences and paragraphs are coherent. None consider the role of grammatical tense. None account for the explanation of acronyms and jargon. None would balk at Jack Torrance's deranged and meaningless draft in The Shining, endlessly repeating "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy".<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But proprietary tech like Lexile has some of the most disconcerting aspects of both worlds. As flawed as Flesch-Kincaid or Dale-Chall, but opaque and unexplainable. The main benefit of the F–K and D–C formulas (and other simple algorithms like Gunning–Fog and SMOG) is their transparency. A broken system locked in a black box can't even offer this.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
</div></div>
      <div class="plain svelte-e1da8e"><div class="svelte-1fij7qx"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We don’t know how Lexile decides how hard each book is. MetaMetrics is the company that made Lexile. They do not share what math they do to get their readability scores. But it is probably close to the other formulas we looked at. We know Lexile looks at:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-1fij7qx"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How long words are.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How long each sentence is.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How familiar the words are.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If things are repeated.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li>
      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->None of these formulas are perfect. They don’t measure:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-1fij7qx"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The order of the sentences.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If the writing makes sense.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Grammar.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If the writer explains hard words and phrases.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li>
      </ul><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These formulas would have no problem with the scene in The Shining where Jack Torrance writes “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” over and over again. They do not check if the writing means anything.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At least we know how Flesch-Kincaid and Dale-Chall work.
